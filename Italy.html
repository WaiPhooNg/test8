      <p>France is the most visited country in the world, it's the most popular tourist spot in the entire world so you're making quite a good choice if you choose to go to France for a vacation or a trip! Not only that but France is one of the most cultured and oldest countries in the world. The national color of France is red, white and blue but they prefer to hold blue as their primary color so we advise you to wear something blue or dark blue when you go there! There's also a lot of interesting and fun cultural and historic sites around Paris, Lyon, Calasis and multiple other cities that we suggest you go to!</p>

      <p>The best time to go to France is in the summer ( June - August ) where the tempature there is mild and warm and the crowds aren't there. It's really nice to go there since the sun is going to shine a lot and the beaches of Normandy would be a great vacation spot, not only that but the Eiffel Tower won't be covered in fog meaning you can get some scenic and wonderful shots of it!</p>

      <p>A small agricultural village was growing on the west coast of Italy around the same time in the 8th century BCE. It established the city of Rome, which grew to become Ancient Rome, one of the world's major civilizations. The Roman Republic would emerge first, followed by the Roman Empire. Much of Europe and the Mediterranean would be under its control. Much of today's western civilisation, including philosophy, art, and law, would be shaped by the influence of Rome and Greek culture. The Roman Empire was split into two parts in 395 CE: the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. The Western Empire, which lasted until 476 CE, included Italy.</p>
